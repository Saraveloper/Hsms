                <h3>Why USA </h3>
                <p> there are so many reasons to study in Sweden. Let’s  jump right into the list… </p>
                <h3>It’s easy to apply </h3>
                <p> Students from around the world used to be able to study in Sweden tuition-free, until recently. However, in 2010, the government passed a new law, that has altered the payment structure for international students from outside the EU/EAA. The new structure includes both the tuition fees and the application fees.</p>
                <h3>Flexible education system </h3>
                <p> American universities and colleges offer a myriad of courses and programs to choose from. You have the freedom to not only select the course content, but also the structure. At the undergraduate level, you have the liberty to pursue different courses before they you declare your major at the end of the second year. This helps to explore your subject interest and then decide without much hurry. Similarly, for your graduate studies, you can choose your preference and when you progress for your dissertation, you can focus on the ideas you want to emphasise upon.</p>
                <h3>Career Opportunities </h3>
                <p> An international degree opens up a wide range of career prospects and a degree from reputed universities widens the scope even further. Due to the varied insight into different fields of study offered by universities of USA, it broadens the scope of the career path that the student chooses and it is known that international companies look for candidates that offer them with a different take or perspective on their products.</p>
