<h3>Why Australia?</h3>
<p>leaving your friends and family behind, you may also be challenged by thoughts of what and where you will study. Here are some of the many reasons why you could consider making Australia your studying-abroad destination.
</p>
<h3>Any major is welcome</h3>
<p> Since Australia's universities are some of the top ranked in the world, it’s no surprise that they offer a multitude of different degrees and majors. Whether you are studying engineering or English, medicine or Mathematics, there are plenty of different options and combinations to choose from when you study in Australia. It could be a good idea to contact your short list of universities prior to see what they offer and whether you meet the eligibility requirements.</p>
<h3>Easy access to student visas</h3>
<p>  If you're looking to get a student visa, Australia offers a streamlined process for the Student Visa (subclass 500). There are several requirements you will need to meet for your application to be approved, including being accepted into an educational institution and having sufficient financial capacity. You will also be required to get an appropriate level of health insurance for the duration of your stay.
</p>
<h3>Internship Availability</h3>
<p> Some Australian universities may offer internships or work opportunities to their students. If this is an option that interests you, be sure to reach out to your chosen educational institution to find out any requirements. </p>
<h3>Easy communication</h3>
<p>  Australians speak English, which makes it easy for most international students to understand and be understood. However, the slang may take a little longer to master! If you’re struggling to keep up with conversation try asking someone to explain the slang to you. You’ll be amazed at the variations Australians have come up with. </p>



    <h3> Five Austrian universities are ranked among the world’s top 500, including:</h3>   

    <a href=""> University of Vienna </a>

   <p>The University of Vienna is the highest-ranked Austrian university, at joint 151st in the world in the QS World University Rankings. It’s also the largest university in Austria, and, having celebrated its 650th anniversary in 2015, the oldest in the German-speaking world. Today it’s one of the largest universities anywhere in Europe, with around 94,000 students enrolled. It teaches across a broad subject spectrum, mostly in German but with a sizeable number of English-taught master’s degrees. The university is associated with 15 Nobel Prize winners, including 2004’s recipient of the Literature Prize, Elfriede Jelinek. Its faculties are spread across more than 60 locations throughout the Austrian capital.</p>

  
        <div style="text-align:center; ">
        <a href=""> University of Innsbruck  </a> <br>

        </div>
   <p>Ranked 281st in the world overall, Universität Innsbruck outdoes even the University of Vienna when it comes to internationalisation. It ranks within the world’s top 35 for its proportion of international students, and the top 95 for proportion of international faculty members. The university’s total student enrolment is around 28,000, making it the third largest in Austria. Its facilities are spread throughout the attractive city of Innsbruck, towards the west of the country, which is renowned as a major snowsports hub. Given this mountain-surrounded location, it’s unsurprising that Universität Innsbruck is particularly renowned for its work in the field of mountain research.
Other Austrian universities ranked among the world’s best include Graz University of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Karl-Franzens-Universitaet Graz and Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.
