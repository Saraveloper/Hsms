                            <p>
                                Statement of Purpose is a reflection of your personality that you portray in front of the admission committee (Adcom) for getting enrolled in universities abroad. It is your chance of impressing the committee by presenting your profile strongly and describing your personality traits that are not covered in your academic documents.
                                <br><br>
                                As the full form of SOP reveals, a Statement of Purpose is an essay stating the purpose of applying to a particular course in a particular university. This essay consists of a gist of who you are, who you want to become, and how ready you are to pursue a certain course in an institution. The essay seeks to understand the candidate’s life, the motivations for the chosen career path and his/her goals. Hence, you should discuss past incidents that have influenced your career path in a specific domain wherein you aspire to grow by joining a course/college.
                                <br><br>
                         
                                There are many elements to a Statement of Purpose or an SOP as it is famously referred to. The Universities could ask question-based essays or simply to present your statement of purpose. Until and unless categorically asked, an SOP must include your goals, the career path you have taken up so far as well as your academic progress. Other elements that are further important to the SOP are also the personal motivations that lead you to choose the university/course you have applied to as well as how you intend to use that experience to achieve that goal.

                            <p>
                                I remember the day as if it were yesterday. During my second year in college, I was attempting to transmit a group of characters comprising my name from one computer to another. I connected the computers using RS-232 cable, wrote the necessary programs and executed them. I typed my name on one terminal and rushed to the other to see the results. "Wow, this is magic!" I exclaimed as I read 'Tom' on the screen. While I realized intuitively that a complex version of this elementary network could achieve much, at the time I had no real idea what. Now, four years later, I know that Networking makes possible a plethora of applications, from video-conferencing over the Internet to linking banks through private networks. It still seems like magic. Or rather, a grand adventure - one that I most certainly want to be part of.
                        <br><br>
                        My interest in applied science dates back to my school days. During high school, I was fascinated with electronic gadgets. Soon thereafter, designing and building basic circuits started as a hobby. Along the way, however, I realized that the problem-solving aspect of making electronic gadgets was what I enjoyed the most. Engineering was a natural career choice after this.
                        <br><br>
                        During my undergraduate studies at the Electronics & Communication department of M.K. College of Engineering, subjects like Microprocessors, C-Programming, Computer Networks interested me the most. I was awestruck by the potential of Intel 8086 microprocessor, more so by the manner in which its faster and more powerful cousins revolutionized the working of computers in a decade. I was now determined to focus on microprocessors during my Final Year project.
                        <br><br>
                        I elected to do the project at National Space Research Organization (NSRO) as it has an outstanding infrastructure setup and a stimulating, world-class research environment. This enabled me to work with some of the best minds dedicated to engineering research in my country. I gained a lot from this association - in particular, an idea of how rewarding and meaningful a career in research could be. The more tangible benefits have been a deeper insight into architecture and working of microprocessors and thorough C-programming skills. Sometimes I spent more than ten hours a day at NSRO, reading manuals and troubleshooting circuits and debugging code. I am glad to say the effort paid off in the end. Mr. Tendulkar, my project guide, deemed the results of my project to be most valuable. The interface card that I designed was later added to NSRO's Spacecraft Interface Simulator (SIS) systems. This project was the highlight of my academic career. Most importantly, I left NSRO with the decision to study advanced computing.

                        During my first job at Neville Engineering and Locomotive Co. (NELCO), I developed a real-time monitoring system for the Molding Line in Foundry. Success on this project gave me the confidence to provide software solutions to real-life problems. Although I liked the job, software development at NELCO was a support function. I therefore switched to Mohinder Belgian Telecom Ltd. (MBT), a multinational company providing software solutions in wide-ranging fields, telecommunications being its forte. At MBT, I have been involved with Project ART, Belgian Telecom's new front-end system providing intelligent access to its Customer Service System (CSS). Working on this project has helped me hone my programming skills on real-life problems. I developed an appreciation of 'the big picture', and conversely how important details are. I also discovered leadership skills in myself, and frequently assisted colleagues who had little or no background in computers. As an outcome of this, the company asked me to take occasional seminars on Operating Systems and C-Programming for my colleagues. I have been appointed Team Leader within a year and today, I independently look after enhancements and maintenance of three modules out of the sixteen in Project ART.
                        <br><br>
                        During my work on project ART at MBT and through my interaction with colleagues, I have grown to admire the role of Computer Networks in empowering end-users. I am not directly involved with Computer Networks in my job, but through avid reading of periodicals and journals like 'Network World', I have sustained my interest in the field. In fact, after reading about the immense potential of path-breaking protocols such as 'Multicast' and applications like 'Voice Over IP' and 'Virtual Private Networks', I cannot help but feel excited about the potential for new research in this area.
                        <br><br>
                        While my present job has helped me develop a thorough insight into project handling, the industry environment that I am currently in cannot support my desire for research. I possess industry-hardened skills in Computers, but I must build on these to achieve my goal of undertaking cutting-edge research in advanced computing, with specific reference to Computer Networks. I therefore believe that I must return to the academic world for further growth.
                        <br><br>
                        I wish to earn an MS degree in Computer Science. I intend to follow this up with a Ph.D., and later, a career in research and teaching. I have spoken to my professors, seniors and colleagues about my choice of University, and have applied to Princeton University because it is reputable for its research facilities and computing resources. The department web site revealed a very strong faculty involved in extensive research in the area of Computer Networks. This has strengthened my resolve to study at Princeton University.
                        <br><br>
                        I bring along a strong grasp of fundamentals in Electronics and Computers, an aptitude for teaching and team work, a zest for challenges and an enthusiastic desire to learn all I can. I would like to take with me, in addition to knowledge of Computer Networks, a network of strong and lasting relationships with my teachers and fellow-students. I hope that my background and qualifications are found suitable for an MS in Computer Science at Princeton University.

                                I am applying to Stockholm University for admission to the Master’s program in Finance. I am interested in Finance, particularly in the Analysis of Approximation Financial market, corporation and international finance.
                        <br><br>
                        My interest in research and analyses goes back to the time I was at school. My father is a finance officer in a bank. This had inculcated in me a love for Finance right from my school days. This interest has only grown through my years in school and high school, as I have learnt more and more. 
                        <br><br>
                        My exposure to Business studies began after I entered the Finance department of my university. The excellent facilities, courses and faculty have given me a firm background of the fundamentals of Finance. Having been exposed to the various facets of Finance in the course of my undergraduate studies, I have found International Finance intellectually most satisfying and stimulating. Courses like `corporate finance’, `working Capital Management’, financial market’ and Investment finance and theory’ have been my firm favorites.
                        <br><br>
                        After carefully considering my aptitude, interests, nature of my training and my ultimate professional ambition, I have decided to pursue a master’s degree in Finance.

                        Of many fields in the finance, I am especially interested in corporate financial management. Within this field, I am interested in investment finance department, corporate governance, production and operation department and financial audit. My junior seminar work, my practical training and my courses have given me plenty of exposure to these areas and I feel that I have sufficient motivation and aptitude to work in this field. I am also interested in financial market. I would like to continue to learn about these areas in my graduate program.
                        <br><br>
                        Stockholm University has been one of the world’s best business Schools. An opportunity to interact with this group would be a golden one for any budding master’s.
                        <br><br>
                        I have realized that Stockholm can provide me with a perfect environment for directing my mental resources towards independent course. I am confident of meeting the high standards of Stockholm University; my active involvement and enthusiasm in my undergraduate studies, which is amply reflected in my result, should serve as proof of my possessing the necessary qualities.
                        <br><br>
                        Having decided that I will engage in the pursuit of a career in Masters, I am fully aware of the implications.

                        <p>
                            I am honored to apply for the Masters of Textile Engineering programs . It is with great pleasure that I prepare a comprehensive study plan to demonstrate my educational aspiration in Sweden. From my childhood I have been always passionate about colors, making collage with papers and make a colorful composition on a piece of paper but I didn't know how to lead this talent and urge of organizing to make it blossom. I have been always concerned about it while I was studying mathematic in high school. My family and friends inspired me to combine theses talents and suggested to study on an engineering subject.
                            <br><br>
                        I chose my specialism as textile designing then I continued by learning more about sketching, pattern and motif designing, dying the fibers and some elementary courses about weaving. The main courses we have passed were mostly focused on various techniques of printing. We experienced the practical courses in the printing workshops and got familiar with dyes, equipment’s of printing and the procedures been taken during the production of fabric. In fact we experienced the hand-made printing Of our own design. 
                        The other most important and precious thing I have had from my bachelor is the ability of developing the ideas and designs and repeats them in the computer software. I learnt how to repeat my pattern in the Photoshop environment in order to make the fabric ready for mass production.
                        <br><br>
                        I have passed Secondary School Certificate Examination in 2008 and Higher Secondary School Certificate Examination in 2010.Then after a huge competitive entrance examination I have got a chance to completed Bachelor of Science in Textile Engineering from Bangladesh University of Business and Technology which is one of the top ranked Universities in Bangladesh.   
                        <br><br>   
                        After admitting in BUBT, I concentrated on developing my ideas to create a successful design. It was a great opportunity, which taught me how to be a bright intelligent designer, how to have a sharp and exact vision of my environment and inspired it to create a textile design in my own language.
                        <br><br>
                        I noticed after two years that I really want to work as a designer's studied a lot about successful designers in textile and I watched lot of their brilliant visual artworks many times and I wished that one day I could create my own designs, see my textiles in market and on people's bodies and having my own brand of designing t-shirts, home furnishing and all these things.
                        After the successful completion of graduation I started my career with globally renowned and LEED certified Textile industry named Remi Holdings Ltd. This apparel industry work multi stages of textile application for its own purpose. So I am very much lucky to have the opportunity to involve myself with wide ranges of textile engineering work such as dying, washing, designing as well as some executive level professional experience. I think it will add confidence in order to apply these experiences in the field of higher study and future job activities.
                        <br><br>
                        But I feel that I'm not still ready for stand in a great place that I have considered for myself in life. I need to learn more about modern techniques of printing, materials, study a bit about fabric history and do more practical courses about designing specifically in textile. Just few steps remained to reach to where I really tried hard for it. I am not still satisfied with myself and I think the Boras University with those amazing courses that offers for its M.Sc can be a very good chance for me to complete my long journey to achieve my desires and goals.
                        <br><br>
                        I feel that higher study from abroad will be the most logical extension of my academic pursuit and a major step towards achieving my objectives. I would be grateful if I am given the opportunity to pursue my studies in Europe and able to justify the faith imposed on me.
