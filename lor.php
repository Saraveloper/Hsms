                                <h1>Why Letter of Recommendation (LOR)?</h1>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Getting into a top notch graduate program is one of the best things you can do for a better career and successful life ahead.
                            <br><br>
                            Schools just don’t want to rely on grades, test scores and resumes as a means of determining the quality of your application. They want to see how well others speak about your work ethic, experience, intelligence and personality. They would like to see how well professors, past and present employers, and other academic faculty feel about your credentials and abilities.
                            <br><br>
                            Letters of Recommendation are required for almost every graduate school application and are a very important part of the application process.
                            <br><br>
                            Usually, when it comes to your application, grades and test scores factor in most heavily. However, your letters of recommendation could be the deciding factor in the admission process.

                            Many top graduate schools ask candidates to send in at least two to three letters of recommendation along with their graduate school application. Some universities may also provide templates to use for writing a graduate school letter of recommendation.
                                </p>
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>
                                Whom to ask for recommendation?
                            </h2>

                                <p>
                                    If your target school requires you to send letters of recommendation, you better ask the right people to write your recommendations.
                            <br><br>
                            Do not ask professors, former supervisors or other individuals with whom you did not develop a serious relationship.
                            <br><br>
                            Most professors will not write a letter of recommendation if they do not know you well enough to vouch for your academics.You don’t want to ask your supervisor, who you barely know, for a recommendation. You may want to avoid asking your uncle as he may not be able to write much about you in a professional capacity. The family connection also downplays the value of this recommendation in the eyes of the committee as there is always a chance of bias.
                            <br><br>
                            You should have known your recommenders for at least six months to a year before asking them for a recommendation. There is a strong likelihood that if someone agrees to right you a letter of recommendation that he will speak highly of you.
                            <br><br>
                            The best letter writers are those that know you well and can provide an evaluation of your ability to perform and succeed at the graduate level.
                            <br><br>
                            Graduate and professional school admissions people tell us the following make the best letter writers:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul class="points">
                            <li>Someone who knows you well.</li>
                            <li>Someone with the title of “Professor”.</li>
                            <li>Someone who is a professor at the school granting your baccalaureate degree.</li>
                            <li>Someone who has earned the degree, which you are seeking in your graduate work.</li>
                            <li>Someone with an advanced degree, who has supervised you in a job or internship aligned with the graduate program you are pursuing (e.g., Public Health, Social Work, Business Administration, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Someone who has academically evaluated you in an upper-division class.</li>
                            <li>Letters from family, friends, and the like are discouraged and, in fact, ma.y be detrimental</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            If you want to seriously strengthen your graduate school application, you should seek recommendations from individuals who have a longstanding history and reputation within a university and/or community.
                            <br><br>
                            Politicians, published professors, prominent lawyers and other civic leaders are also good sources of recommendations.
                            <br><br>
                            This is not to discount relatively unknown people, but there is a strong likelihood a graduate program will like your application if a high profile individual has written a letter of recommendation for you.
                            <br><br>
                            Finally and most importantly when soliciting someone to write a letter of recommendation, it is important to let these individuals know what your educational intentions are, the program you are applying to and other key pieces of information that they can use to write the best letter of recommendation possible.
                                </p>

                                If you are going to get LORs from two of your professors, they should write about two different aspects of your personality, achievements and academic potential. Here are two possible ways for those professors to write about you:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul class="points">
                            <li>Professor 1 can talk about your achievements during your project. For example, your project led to a patent filing or your project was commercialized to a product worth $10 million in yearly sales.</li>
                            <li>Professor 2 can write about your classroom performance. For example, you were a hard-working and sincere student and were among top 10% of your class.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <br><br>

                            <p>
                                Dear Admissions Committee,
                            <br><br>
                            I had the pleasure of teaching Sara in her 11th grade honors English class at Mark Twain High School. From the first day of class, Sara impressed me with her ability to be articulate about difficult concepts and texts, her sensitivity to the nuances within literature, and her passion for reading, writing, and creative expression- both in and out of the classroom. Sara is a talented literary critic and poet, and she has my highest recommendation as a student and writer.
                            <br><br>
                            Sara is talented at considering the subleties within literature and the purpose behind authors' works. She produced an extraordinary year-long thesis paper on creative identity development, in which she compared works from three different time periods and synthesized cultural and historical perspectives to inform her analysis. When called upon to give her thesis defense in front of her peers, Sara spoke clearly and eloquently about her conclusions and responded to questions in a thoughtful way. Outside of the classroom, Sara is dedicated to her literary pursuits, especially to poetry. She publishes her poetry in our school's literary magazine, as well as in online magazines. She is an insightful, sensitive, and deeply self-aware individual driven to explore art, writing, and a deeper understanding of the human condition.
                            <br><br>
                            Throughout the year Sara was an active participant in our discussions, and she always supported her peers. Her caring nature and personality allow her to work well with others in a team setting, as she always respects others' opinions even when they differ from her own. When we held a class debate about gun laws, Sara opted to speak for the side opposite her own views. She explained her choice as motivated by a desire to put herself in other people's shoes, view the issues from a new perspective, and gain a clearer sense of the issue from all angles. Throughout the year, Sara demonstrated this openness to and empathy for the opinions, feelings, and perspectives of others, along with shrewd powers of observation, all qualities that makes her outstanding as a student of literature and burgeoning writer.
                            <br><br>
                            I am certain that Sara is going to continue to do great and creative things in her future. I highly recommend her for admission to your undergraduate program. She is talented, caring, intuitive, dedicated, and focused in her pursuits. Sara consistently seeks out constructive feedback so she can improve her writing skills, which is a rare and impressive quality in a high school student. Sara is truly a stand-out individual who will impress everyone she meets. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at callmeclemens@gmail.com.
                            <br><br>
                            Sincerely,
                            <br><br>
                            Ms. Scribe<br>
